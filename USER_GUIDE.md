## Understanding AutoFlow

### The Basic Concept

AutoFlow uses a simple **"If This, Then That"** logic:

```
IF [Trigger Happens] ‚Üí THEN [Perform Action]
```

**Example**:
- IF "I arrive at work" (Location Trigger)
- THEN "Set phone to silent" (Action)

### Key Terms

- **Workflow**: A complete automation rule (Trigger + Action)
- **Trigger**: An event that starts the automation (e.g., time, location)
- **Action**: What happens when the trigger activates (e.g., notification, toggle WiFi)
- **Enable/Disable**: Turn workflows on or off without deleting them
