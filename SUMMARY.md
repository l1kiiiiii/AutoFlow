# AutoFlow - Repository Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

This document provides a high-level summary of the comprehensive analysis performed on the AutoFlow Android automation application repository (l1kiii-1 branch).

---

## üéØ What is AutoFlow?

**AutoFlow** is an Android automation application that enables users to create event-driven workflows using an "if-this-then-that" paradigm. Users can:

- Define **triggers** (time, location, WiFi, Bluetooth)
- Define **actions** (notifications, settings changes, scripts)
- Create **workflows** that execute automatically

**Example**: "When I arrive at work (location trigger), set my phone to vibrate (action)"
